1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
  - the breakpoint sets the point that the application is paused and the debugger is launched.

2.  Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
  - No, the application will run as normal until the breakpoint, at which point it pauses before the line it is on is run.

3. How do we debug the next line of code?
  - When we select the 'step over' option it will run the line of code it is on and then move onto the next  line.

4. What does the step into command do?
  - the 'step into' command allows you to see what is happening within a method. It switches to the class that the method is contained in and pauses at the top of the method

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
  - Evaluate expression allows us to perform java code and call methods on the instances of the objects   we've created so far.
  Evaluate code fragment lets us run multiple methods and multiple lines of code and also create temporary variables.
